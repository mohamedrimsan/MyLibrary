📚 My Personal Library
Welcome to My Library — a curated collection of book notes, summaries, insights, and resources that I’ve gathered over time. Whether you're a fellow reader, a lifelong learner, or just curious about what I’ve been reading, this repository is here to share knowledge and spark ideas.

🗂️ What's Inside
This library includes:
• 	✍️ Book Notes: Key takeaways, quotes, and reflections from books I’ve read — both fiction and nonfiction.
• 	🧠 Summaries: Concise overviews of books, organized by theme or topic.
• 	📎 Resources: Links to articles, videos, or tools that complement the reading.
• 	🗃️ Categories: Books are grouped by genre, author, or subject (e.g., psychology, productivity, philosophy, etc.).

 believe that reading is only half the journey — the other half is remembering and applying what you’ve read. This library helps me:
• 	Retain and revisit key ideas
• 	Share knowledge with others
• 	Reflect on how books shape my thinking

🧭 How to Navigate
• 	Each book has its own folder or markdown file.
• 	Notes are written in plain, readable Markdown.
• 	Tags and categories help you find what you're looking for quickly.

🤝 Contributions
This is a personal project, but I welcome:
• 	Suggestions for new books to read
• 	Feedback on notes or summaries
• 	Thoughtful discussions about the ideas within
Feel free to open an issue or start a conversation!

📌 Disclaimer
All notes are my personal interpretations and reflections. They are not substitutes for reading the original works — and I highly encourage you to read the books yourself!
